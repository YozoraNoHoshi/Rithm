Part 1
1. git clean removes untracked/unmerged files from the working directory
2. -d removes untracked directories, while -f forces removal (since clean.requireForce variable is usually true by default).
3. git checkout -b branchName
4. Fast forward merges occur when no commits have been made since branching, recursives occur when a different commit was made to the merge branch
5. git checkout branchName
6. git checkout
7. git branch -D branchName
8. Shows the changes in the working tree that are unstaged for the next commit
9. git rm --cached fileName (pass -r to remove a folder)
10. During a recursive merge wwhen changes are committed to the same file on different branches. Git doesnt know which one to use so it makes the human do it.
